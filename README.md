# HacktoberfestCalcPi
Repository for the Hacktoberfest which should be filled with solutions calculating Pi

As you can see from the description, the aim here is to calculate Pi with different methods. There are many different algorithms for it and everyone should get the chance to try his problem solution.

To make it work the way I want it to, I'll set up a few rules for you:

1. The language doesn't matter you could even use a esoteric language unless you specify how to run it.
2. Each solution should be stored in its own directory, please name them wise.
3. Each solution should contain a small document in which the algorithm used is explained. It doesn't have to be a scientific, mathematical work (unless you want to). A rough explanation and a Wikipedia URL does the trick as well.
4. You should leave it to the user how many decimal places he wants to calculate. Or just give them a way to cancel the process. Works too.

I think everything is said, have fun at the Hacktoberfest, I am looking forward to your PRs.
